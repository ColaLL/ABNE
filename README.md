Description of Data directory

## AcrossNetworkEmbeddingData

### foursquare:

embeddings directory for storing the embedding generated by ABNE model.		

### twitter:

### twitter_foursquare_groundtruth:

groundtruth.x.foldtrain.train.number, the traning anchors, which are the 0.x of all the anchors.
		
groundtruth.x.foldtrain.test.number,  the testing anchors, which are the 1-0.x of all the anchors.
    
note that users only appear in the "groundtruth" file are the training anchors (even there are some uses have same ids, they are not anchors)
