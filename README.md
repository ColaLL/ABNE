# ABNE
The code and dataset for paper "ABNE: An Attention Based Network Embedding for User Alignment Across Social Networks"


With the permission of sharing anonymous twitter_foursquare data from Prof.Jiawei Zhang, 
we share the anonymous data and code of IONE here. 
Note that the data and code only can be used for research purposes.

When running the code, firstly check the Vars.java to make sure that the path of the data is correct. New two folds which are named as "embeddings" in foursquare fold and twitter fold.

Description of Data directory

AcrossNetworkEmbeddingData

foursquare:
	
		following.number: the relation file, "1  2" means user 1 is the follower of user 2.  			   			
    embeddings directory for storing the embedding generated by ABNE model.		

twitter:
		the same as the foursquare fold	


twitter_foursquare_groundtruth:

    groundtruth.x.foldtrain.train.number, the traning anchors, which are the 0.x of all the anchors.
		
		groundtruth.x.foldtrain.test.number,  the testing anchors, which are the 1-0.x of all the anchors.
    
    note that users only appear in the train file are the training anchors (although users have same ids but are not in training file
